# Advanced-BlockLogger
Plugin for Minebuilder

This was a plugin I made for the Minebuilder mobile game(a Minecraft clone) a very long time ago.
It's purpose was to log whenever a player broke or placed a block in the world. This was made so server owners could find out which players were damaging other players' creations.

Written in Java. Uses an SQLite Database to store the logged data.
